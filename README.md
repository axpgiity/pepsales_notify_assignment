##  Features

- FastAPI backend with REST endpoints  
- Background worker using RabbitMQ (via Pika)  
- Retry logic for failed messages  
- Dockerized setup (API + RabbitMQ + Worker)  

---

##  Tech Stack

- FastAPI (Python)  
- RabbitMQ (Message Queue)  
- Docker + Docker Compose  

---

## üß™ API Endpoints

### ‚û§ Send Notification

**POST** `/notifications`

```json

  "message": "Hello from the Notification Service!"
}
```

### ‚û§ Get All Notifications for a User

**GET** `/users/{user_id}/notifications`

---

## üêá RabbitMQ Dashboard

- **URL**: `http://localhost:15672`  
- **Login**: `guest` / `guest`

You can inspect queues, bindings, and message history here.

---

## Assumptions

- All notification types are logged instead of actually sending real emails/SMS.
- SQLite is used for demonstration; you can plug in PostgreSQL or MongoDB easily.
- This project is structured to easily extend with Celery, Redis, or Kafka.
